# Assignment 1

## Task:

1. Implement given design (`design.png`) in HTML and CSS. </br>
   (design.png is in the same folder as this README.md file)
2. Try to come up with your own solution and do not use any CSS framework. The content can be hardcoded and you can use any font and images.

## Assumptions made:

1. The design is not responsive and the content is centered.
2. The design is implemented using flexbox.
3. Solution allows for HTML, CSS and JS files.

## Technical decisions:

1. The design is implemented using flexbox.
2. Children within (`<body>`) consist of (`<header>`) and (`<main>`) since there is no footer based on the design.
3. Used CSS variables for colors and font sizes. (for easy customization)
4. Used JS to create the backlog, todo and done column content dynamically. (for easy customization)
5.

## How to run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
