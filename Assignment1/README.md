# Assignment 1

## Task:

1. Implement given design (`design.png`) in HTML and CSS. </br>
   (design.png is in the same folder as this README.md file)
2. Try to come up with your own solution and do not use any CSS framework. The content can be hardcoded and you can use any font and images.
3. The design is not responsive, but you can make it responsive if you want to.

## Assumptions made:

1. The design is not responsive.
2. Solution for non mobile view is with HTML and CSS. (no JS)
3. Solution for mobile view allows for JS. (as it is a bonus).

## Technical decisions:

1. The design is implemented using flexbox since it is easier to implement and maintain.
2. Children within (`<body>`) consist of (`<header>`) and (`<main>`) since there is no footer based on the design.
3. Used CSS variables for colors and font sizes. (for easy customization)
4. Used JS for pagination during mobile view. (using jQuery)

## Instructions on how to run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open assignment1 folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
